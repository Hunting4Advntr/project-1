            Scotland's history is a captivating tale of ancient clans, battles,

            conflicts and the eventual union with England, Scotland's past is

    <!-- About -->
    <div id="about">
      <h1>In the Begining...</h1>
      <p>
        The origins of Scotland can be traced back to the early medieval period
        when various Celtic tribes inhabited the region. In the 9th century, the
        Kingdom of Scotland emerged through the fusion of the Pictish and Gaelic
        cultures. The Kingdom of Alba, as it was initially known, expanded its
        influence and faced intermittent clashes with the Kingdom of England. In
        1296, Scotland's independence was temporarily lost after being conquered
        by England, but Scottish resistance, led by figures like William Wallace
        and Robert the Bruce, eventually led to the reestablishment of Scottish
        sovereignty. The Kingdom of Scotland persisted as an independent nation
        until the Act of Union in 1707, which united Scotland with England to
        form the Kingdom of Great Britain.
